# Many of the important settings are passed to Django via environment
# variables. Source this file before 'python manage.py runserver...' Adjust as
# needed to any local test settings. Since you don't want to check this in all
# the time (with your real values no less), just make a copy that is not under
# version control and which you can edit.
#
# There are three different settings files: local, test and deploy.  Here, we
# should define 'local', since that is used when you are testing your server
# locally on your development machine. For the running of unit tests, you
# should use the 'test' settings file.
